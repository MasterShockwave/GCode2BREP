if the command is G0 or G1, find the point data and count it as current point.
	note that if one coord is missing, then this remains the same as the previous value.
if there is an E command in the code, draw a line from previous point to current point.
if not, store current point but don't draw line.

for each line in gcode
	does the line begin with G0 or G1?
		does the line have an E value in it
			current point = XYZ (read)
			create line b/w prev point and current point. If previous point is null, then goto Next line (break loop)

previous point = current point
